It was a sunny day at the bungo stray dogs school. Every teenager started gathering around, talking with their friends. In the quiet corner sat Akutagawa, with his head laying on the cold hard wall. He sighed, the wind moving his hair slightly. As he looked up, he heard a familiar voice.

*'Akutagawa-san! There you are, i looked everywhere for you.'*

Of course, it was Atsushi. The boy he despised yet always came running to him. He gave his neutral expression off along with a small 'tch'

*'What do you want now?'*

He said calmly, the white haired boy just wanted to talk, that's all. Ever since school started, Atsushi has been attempting to be friends with him, well it isn't official, but he considers him as one. Akutagawa looked at him again, slowly getting pissed off because of how *long* he's taking to reply. 

In the Meantime, Atsushi felt akward, he slowly got red in the face. Well, he just shaked it off.

*Ah, nothing. Did i disturb you Akutagawa-san?*

Damn it. That nickname always pisses him off, he just wanted him to go away. Suddenly, the bells rung, hinting everyone to enter the School.

As they went in thru the hallways, the shy boy attempted once again to start a conversation, asking about his day, but Akutagawa didn't reply, how rude!

Meanwhile, Dazai and Chuuya were in the classroom, anooying each other again. Since Dazai started humiliating him infront of the whole class, Chuuya started an argument, saying any possible rude thing coming out his mouth.

*'Sheeshh, no need to get all angry, Chibi!'*

Immedially, Dazai was hit with a reply.

*'Shut the hell up Mackerel!'*

The tall young man chuckled, laughing over his so intimidating speech, also over the fact that he's shorter than other girls. Their classmates nearby laughed at them, saying how Daza-

Chuuya's mind:
*DAZAI?! Why is HE the funny one?! I'll show that Bastard!*

They continued arguing (with Dazai just laughing the hell out of him) until the bell rung once again. Everyone almost immedially sat down and watched as the Teacher entered, greeting her. Meanwhile Chuuya still looked pissed off, and kept staring at the brown haired boy sitting next to him, which the Teacher noticed.
